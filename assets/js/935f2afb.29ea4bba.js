We want to capture the biofilm that will grow on transparent surfaces over time under water to get an idea what\'s happening. The core idea is to build an ESP32-based microscope, which fits into a watertight container. You focus it once to see the furface of the container sharp and release it into the wild, where it will capture images periodically.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"APP":{"id":"APP","title":"Anglerfish APP User Guide","description":"Welcome to the Anglerfish APP user guide!
