We don't magnify at all, but since the pixels of the OV2460 camera are really small, and we use the objective lens with a relatively small focal length (f'=~5mm), we perform a \"4f-imaging\". In this context, this means, we have a sample at a distance of 2f (focal lengths) in front of the lens, which will, in turn, create an image at 2f away from it. The camera chip will digitize the image and send it over to your displaying device. You can tune the magnification by changing the distance between the sample-lens and the lens-sensor.

Luckily, we can use it to illuminate our sample for transmission microscopy. Wait, how can that be done? Easy!
