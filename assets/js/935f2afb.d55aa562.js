We want to capture the biofilm that will grow on transparent surfaces over time under water to get an idea what\'s happening. The core idea is to build an ESP32-based microscope, which fits into a watertight container. You focus it once to see the furface of the container sharp and release it into the wild, where it will capture images periodically.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Variants/ESPectrometer":{"id":"Variants/ESPectrometer","title":"ESPectrometer","description":"More coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Variants/ESPressoScope":{"id":"Variants/ESPressoScope","title":"ESPressoscope (Injection Molded Version of the Matchboxscope)","description":"A Cup-sized microscope that never sleeps.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Variants/Fluidiscope":{"id":"Variants/Fluidiscope","title":"Fluidiscope","description":"Microscopy is a key tool in many scientific fields, including medical research, environmental monitoring, and materials science.
