We want to capture the biofilm that will grow on transparent surfaces over time under water to get an idea what\'s happening. The core idea is to build an ESP32-based microscope, which fits into a watertight container. You focus it once to see the furface of the container sharp and release it into the wild, where it will capture images periodically.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ESPectrometer":{"id":"ESPectrometer","title":"ESPectrometer","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"FlashTheCode":{"id":"FlashTheCode","title":"Flash the Firmware","description":"You can access the online-flashing tool here","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Fluidiscope":{"id":"Fluidiscope","title":"Fluidiscope","description":"Microscopy is a key tool in many scientific fields, including medical research, environmental monitoring, and materials science. However, current microscopy techniques often have limitations in terms of accessibility, flexibility, and high-throughput sample monitoring. To address these challenges, we developed an ESP32-based microscope with a peristaltic pump module for continuous or controlled flow. It can be used for microplastics, yeast, plankton... find it out! :)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction":{"id":"Introduction","title":"ESP32-Based Microscopy","description":"This is the hub for the smallest standalone low-cost open-source DIY microscope system that can be used for a gazillion different applications.
